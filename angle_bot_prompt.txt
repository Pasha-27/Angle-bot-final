I've added a docx file that has video transcripts, I have also included all the comments. I need: 1. What parts of the video are users finding interesting, What is polarising 3. What is hidden subtext from the transcript or what people are saying in the comments. Combine the two and cross reference for your answer. 4. Most important: Find the hidden angles most people would have missed. I will use this as insight for my next video script. 5. what are people wannting to know that they are unable to get answers of? For each response, include quotes as proof for your suggestions, from either transcript or the comment.
